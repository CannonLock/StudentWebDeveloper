# Submitting work for review

All the websites have a built-in preview functionality. To trigger this functionality you must push a 
branch that is prefixed with `preview-` to the main repository. 

CHTC Example:

Let's say I added a new team member in my current branch. 

1. Checkout these changes into a new branch called `preview-add-team-member`. 
2. Push this new branch to the root repository (https://github.com/CHTC/chtc-website-source.git)
    - You will be able to see the progress bar here: https://github.com/CHTC/chtc-website-source/actions
    - You will be able to see the preview is complete when the latest action is completed here: https://github.com/CHTC/web-preview/actions
3. Create a new Pull Request with that branch on the root repository. 
4. Comment the link to the preview: (https://chtc.github.io/web-preview/preview-add-team-member)
5. Your code is ready for review!
